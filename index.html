    <h1>Croissants are amazing!</h1>

    <h3>
      Crescent-shaped breads have been made since the Renaissance, and
      crescent-shaped cakes possibly since antiquity. Croissants have long been
      a staple of Austrian, Italian, and French bakeries and pâtisseries. The
      modern croissant was developed in the early 20th century. In the late
      1970s, the development of factory-made, frozen, preformed but unbaked
      dough made them into a fast food that could be freshly baked by unskilled
      labor. The croissant bakery, notably the La Croissanterie chain, was a
      French response to American-style fast food, and as of 2008, 30–40% of the
      croissants sold in French bakeries and patisseries were baked from frozen
      dough.
